# DePSI: Delft PS-InSAR processing package

DePSI (van Leijen, 2014) is an open source software for processing Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PS-InSAR) data, originally implemented in MATLAB. From 2024, TUDelft and Netherlands eScience Center are collaborating to develop a Python version of DePSI, with recent advances in PS-InSAR. 

For the stable version of DePSI implemented in MATLAB, please refer to the [stable branch](https://github.com/TUDelftGeodesy/DePSI/tree/stable).
